  as a backend software engineer. I like learning and experimenting with new
  technologies and I quench my thirst for knowledge by diving deep into the
  technologies I work with.</p>
  <p>I mostly (but not limited) work with tools, libraries and frameworks in the
  Java ecosystem. I also like to tinker with Javascript, Ruby, Python and C.</p>
  <p>I am passionate about developing well written software which is scaleable,
  reliable and resilliant. I practice and preach writting clean code and
  following TDD.</p>
  <p>Apart from technology I love watching movies, web and tv shows and getting to
  know history.</p>
