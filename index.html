        I am a software engineer from India. I work at <a href="https://freshworks.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" rel="noopener">Freshworks</a> as a backend software engineer.
        I like learning and experimenting with new technologies and I quench my thirst for knowledge by diving deep into the technologies I work with.
        <br>
        I mostly (but not limited) work with tools, libraries and frameworks in the Java ecosystem. I also like to tinker with Javascript, Ruby, Python and C.
        <br>
        I am passionate about developing well written software which is scaleable, reliable and resilliant. I practice and preach writting clean code and following TDD. 
        <br>
        Apart from technology I love watching movies, web and tv series and getting to know history.
