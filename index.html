    Hi! I'm Hari, a software engineer from India. I work at
    <a

      target="_blank"
      rel="noreferrer"

      >Freshworks</a

    as a backend software engineer. I like learning and experimenting with new
    technologies and I quench my thirst for knowledge by diving deep into the
    technologies I work with.
  </p>
  <p>
    I mostly work with tools, libraries and frameworks in the
    <strong>Java</strong> ecosystem but also tinker with
    <strong>Javascript</strong>, <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>C</strong>.
    Recently I've started learning <strong>Erlang</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am passionate about developing well written software which is reliable,
    resilient and can massively scale. I believe that software engineering is
    much more than just writing functional code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Apart from software engineering I like learning history and mathematics,
    watching movies and tv shows, playing cricket and cooking.
